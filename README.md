CMPT 308 LAB 02 README

How to run:
1. Create database called cmpt308_lab2
2. Open Query Tool in pgAdmin
3. Run lab02.sql

This will create tables, insert data, and run the required queries.


During this lab I started by creating tables for students, courses, and enrollments. I then added primary and foreign keys, inserted the required data, then performed a series of queries on this data. I also provided relational algebra expressions for 2 of the performed queries, as detailed in my PDF.
